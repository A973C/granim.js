# Contributing

As `granim` is a small project with a few maintainers, we'd like to make sure that it's easy for you to contribute, and that it's easy for us to manage incoming PRs. In that interest -

1. Fork the Repo
2. Clone
3. Run `npm install`
4. Make Changes
5. Add any required tests to the `/test/test.html` file
6. Run `grunt`
7. Run `npm start` and check `localhost:8080` to ensure that everything works
8. Commit and Push
9. Open a Pull Request

### Guidelines

We'd like to make sure your code is like our:

1. `"use strict";`
2. Use semicolons `;`
3. We prefer `'` to `"`
4. Use 1 tabe for indentation, no spaces

With all of that, you should have a PR submitted and merged in no time.

Thanks for helping us out! :)
